## Synopsis

This simple script parses output from IITC Bookmarked Portal in a specific Group. Then creates a JSON file for importing them into Notify Helper.

## Motivation

I have a bunch of portals I track in both Ingress Intel (IIC Bookmarks) and Notify Helper.  I wanted an easier way, instead of hacking in a text editor.

## Usage
python bookmark2notifyhelper.py [Group] [input JSON] [Output JSON]

Input JSON is from a copy/paste output of IITC Bookmarks into a file.

Output JSON can be imported into Notify Helper App.
